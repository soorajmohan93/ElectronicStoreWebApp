# ElectronicStoreWebApp
Electronic Store Web Application

- There are few changes from Project Proposal. Instead of customer facing application, I am developing a vendor facing app for the electronic store.
- Vendor can add/edit/delete Product Categories and Product.
- List of available categories and products are shown as tiles on the home page.
- API can also provide list of products and categories, edit and delete the same.
- Vendor can also add customers and create carts with products for customers
- Create, edit and delete functionality will only if user is logged in.
- Adding quantity in cart will reduce quantity in stock. Quantity in cart cannot exceed stock quantity
- Product can be searched by Product name 
- Carts can be filtered based on customer name

Future Plans
- I will try adding functionality which will allow vendor to upload product images in future
- Customer can create their own cart or use cart created for them by vendor to place an order
- Vendor can update order status
- Order status can be tracked by customer
- Ability for customer to cancel order
