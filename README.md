# ElectronicStoreWebApp
Electronic Store Web Application

- There are few changes from Project Proposal. Instead of customer facing application, I am developing a vendor facing app for the electronic store.
- Vendor can add/edit/delete Product Categories and Product.
- List of available categories and products are shown as tiles on the home page.
- API can also provide list of products and categories, edit and delete the same.
- Vendor can also add customers and create carts with products for customers (Development in Progress)

Create, edit and delete functionality will only if user is logged in.
